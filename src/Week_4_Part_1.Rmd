```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

## 1. Confidence Intervals

```{r}
dolphin_length <- c(38, 41, 50, 27, 32, 41, 48, 60, 43)

t.test(dolphin_length)
```

## 2. T-test (1-sample t-test) - specificy null hypothesis for t-test

See a claim: mean dolphin length is 50 inches

```{r}
dolphin_test <- t.test(x = dolphin_length, mu = 50)
dolphin_test
```

## 3. Two-sample t-test

```{r}
desert_bighorns <- c(32, 44, 18, 26, 50, 33, 42, 40)
sierra_bighorns <- c(28, 31, 40, 42, 26, 29, 31)

t.test(x = desert_bighorns, y = sierra_bighorns)
```
